# 4.2.0

## Major updates
- Added particle editor to the Inspector ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh)

## Updates

### General

- Refactored React refs from old string API to React.createRef() API ([Kyle Belfort](https://github.com/belfortk)

- Scale on one axis for `BoundingBoxGizmo` ([cedricguillemet](https://github.com/cedricguillemet))

- Simplified code contributions by fully automating the dev setup with gitpod ([nisarhassan12](https://github.com/nisarhassan12))
- Add a `CascadedShadowMap.IsSupported` method and log an error instead of throwing an exception when CSM is not supported ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))

### Engine

- Allow logging of shader code when a compilation error occurs ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Add back support for selecting textures based on engine capabilities ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))

### NME

- NME Frames are now resizable from the corners ([Kyle Belfort](https://github.com/belfortk)

### Inspector

- Handle PBR colors as colors in linear space ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Allow removing textures ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Edit all textures (anisotropic, clear coat, sheen, ...) for the PBR materials ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))

### Cameras

- Added flag to TargetCamera to invert rotation direction and multiplier to adjust speed ([Exolun](https://github.com/Exolun))
- Added upwards and downwards keyboard input to `FreeCamera` ([Pheater](https://github.com/pheater))

### Physics

- Ammo.js IDL exposed property update and raycast vehicle stablization support ([MackeyK24](https://github.com/MackeyK24))
- Recast.js plugin nav mesh and crowd agent to ref performance optimizations. ([MackeyK24](https://github.com/MackeyK24))

### Loaders

- Added support for glTF mesh instancing extension ([#7521](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/issues/7521)) ([drigax](https://github.com/Drigax))

### Navigation
- export/load prebuilt binary navigation mesh ([cedricguillemet](https://github.com/cedricguillemet))

### Materials

- Added the `roughness` and `albedoScaling` parameters to PBR sheen ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Updated the energy conservation factor for the clear coat layer in PBR materials ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Added the `transparencyMode` property to the `StandardMaterial` class ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Added to `FresnelParameters` constructor options and equals method ([brianzinn](https://github.com/brianzinn))
- Added `AddAttribute` to `CustomMaterial` and `PBRCustomMaterial` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- `setTexture` and `setTextureArray` from `ShaderMaterial` take now a `BaseTexture` as input instead of a `Texture`, allowing to pass a `CubeTexture` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))

### WebXR

- Added optional ray and mesh selection predicates to `WebXRControllerPointerSelection` ([Exolun](https://github.com/Exolun))
- Implemented the new WebXR HitTest API ([#7364](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/issues/7364)) ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))

### Collisions
- Added an option to optimize collision detection performance ([jsdream](https://github.com/jsdream)) - [PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/7810)

### Animation
- Added support for Additive Animation Blending. Existing animations can be converted to additive using the new MakeAnimationAdditive method for Skeletons, AnimationGroups and Animations. Animations can be played additively using the new isAdditive input parameter to the begin animation methods. ([c-morten](https://github.com/c-morten))
